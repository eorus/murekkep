> Pardus has become another promising GNU/Linux desktop distribution that fortunatly gets a lot of attention lately. Very good.
> 
> What i like about Pardus is the fact that they actually try to improve a lot of things, make stuff easier or improve usability, and not just present another combination of well known tools. Besides the package manager discussed here they work on the init system (Murdur), an application ability hub (Comar), an easy installer (Yali) and finally a much more straight-forward KDE control center.
