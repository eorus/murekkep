> _Fellow Linuxers,__This is just to announce the imminent completion of a brand-new Linux release,which I&#8217;m calling the Debian Linux Release. This is a release that I have put together basically from scratch; in other words, I didn&#8217;t simply make some changes to SLS and call it a new release. I was inspired to put together this release after running SLS and generally being dissatisfied with much of it, and after much altering of SLS I decided that it would be easier to start from scratch. The base system is now virtually complete (though I&#8217;m still looking around to make sure that I grabbed the most recent sources for  
> everything), and I&#8217;d like to get some feedback before I add the &#8220;fancy&#8221; stuff._
